Scanner App

The Scanner App collects data using sensors on an Android/iOS device. User moves around holding the device with Scanner app installed to scan the scene. Once the scanning is completed, users can upload the data to the staging server. You can view a detailed documentation for [iOS](./scanner/ios/README.md) and [Android](./scanner/android/README.md). You can also view their detailed class structure [iOS here](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/multiscan/ios) and [Android here](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/multiscan/android).
